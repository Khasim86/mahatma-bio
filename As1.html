        Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad in British India. His father, Motilal Nehru
        (1861–1931), a self-made wealthy barrister who was born into to the Kashmiri Pandit community, served twice as
        president of the Indian National Congress, in 1919 and 1928.[5][6] His mother, Swarup Rani Thussu (1868–1938),
        who came from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in Lahore,[7] was Motilal's second wife, his first
    having died in childbirth. Jawaharlal</p>

           <p> Jawaharlal Nehru (born November 14, 1889, Allahabad, India—died May 27, 1964, New Delhi) was the first prime
            minister of independent India (1947–64), who established parliamentary government and became noted for his
            neutralist (nonaligned) policies in foreign affairs. He was also one of the principal leaders of India’s
            independence movement in the 1930s and ’40s.

            Early years
            Nehru was born to a family of Kashmiri Brahmans, noted for their administrative aptitude and scholarship,
            who had migrated to Delhi early in the 18th century. He was a son of Motilal Nehru, a renowned lawyer and
            leader of the Indian independence movement, who became one of Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi’s prominent
            associates. Jawaharlal was the eldest of four children, two of whom were girls. A sister, Vijaya Lakshmi
            Pandit, later became the first woman president of the United Nations General Assembly.

            Until the age of 16, Nehru was educated at home by a series of English governesses and tutors. Only one of
            those—a part-Irish, part-Belgian theosophist, Ferdinand Brooks—appears to have made any impression on him.
            Jawaharlal also had a venerable Indian tutor who taught him Hindi and Sanskrit. In 1905 he went to Harrow, a
            leading English school, where he stayed for two years. Nehru’s academic career was in no way outstanding.
            From Harrow he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years earning an honours degree in
            natural science. On leaving Cambridge he qualified as a barrister after two years at the Inner Temple,
            London, where in his own words he passed his examinations “with neither glory nor ignominy.”

            The seven years Nehru spent in England left him in a hazy half-world, at home neither in England nor in
            India. Some years later he wrote, “I have become a queer mixture of East and West, out of place everywhere,
            at home nowhere.” He went back to India to discover India. The contending pulls and pressures that his
            experience abroad were to exert on his personality were never completely resolved.

            Four years after his return to India, in March 1916, Nehru married Kamala Kaul, who also came from a
            Kashmiri family that had settled in Delhi. Their only child, Indira Priyadarshini, was born in 1917; she
            would later (under her married name of Indira Gandhi) also serve (1966–77 and 1980–84) as prime minister of
            India. In addition, Indira’s son Rajiv Gandhi succeeded his mother as prime minister (1984–89).

            Political apprenticeship
            On his return to India, Nehru at first had tried to settle down as a lawyer. Unlike his father, however, he
            had only a desultory interest in his profession and did not relish either the practice of law or the company
            of lawyers. For that time he might be described, like many of his generation, as an instinctive nationalist
            who yearned for his country’s freedom, but, like most of his contemporaries, he had not formulated any
            precise ideas on how it could be achieved.

            Nehru’s autobiography discloses his lively interest in Indian politics during the time he was studying
            abroad. His letters to his father over the same period reveal their common interest in India’s freedom. But
            not until father and son met Mahatma Gandhi and were persuaded to follow in his political footsteps did
            either of them develop any definite ideas on how freedom was to be attained. The quality in Gandhi that
            impressed the two Nehrus was his insistence on action. A wrong, Gandhi argued, should not only be condemned
            but be resisted. Earlier, Nehru and his father had been contemptuous of the run of contemporary Indian
            politicians, whose nationalism, with a few notable exceptions, consisted of interminable speeches and
            long-winded resolutions. Jawaharlal was also attracted by Gandhi’s insistence on fighting against British
            rule of India without fear or hate.

            Nehru met Gandhi for the first time in 1916 at the annual meeting of the Indian National Congress (Congress
            Party) in Lucknow. Gandhi was 20 years his senior. Neither seems to have made any initially strong
            impression on the other. Gandhi makes no mention of Nehru in an autobiography he dictated while imprisoned
            in the early 1920s. The omission is understandable, since Nehru’s role in Indian politics was secondary
            until he was elected president of the Congress Party in 1929, when he presided over the historic session at
            Lahore (now in Pakistan) that proclaimed complete independence as India’s political goal. Until then the
            party’s objective had been dominion status.

            Nehru’s close association with the Congress Party dates from 1919 in the immediate aftermath of World War I.
            That period saw an early wave of nationalist activity and governmental repression, which culminated in the
            Massacre of Amritsar in April 1919; according to an official report, 379 persons were killed (though other
            estimates were considerably higher), and at least 1,200 were wounded when the local British military
            commander ordered his troops to fire on a crowd of unarmed Indians assembled in an almost completely
            enclosed space in the city.

            When, late in 1921, the prominent leaders and workers of the Congress Party were outlawed in some provinces,
            Nehru went to prison for the first time. Over the next 24 years he was to serve another eight periods of
            detention, the last and longest ending in June 1945, after an imprisonment of almost three years. In all,
            Nehru spent more than nine years in jail. Characteristically, he described his terms of incarceration as
            normal interludes in a life of abnormal political activity.

            His political apprenticeship with the Congress Party lasted from 1919 to 1929. In 1923 he became general
            secretary of the party for two years, and he did so again in 1927 for another two years. His interests and
            duties took him on journeys over wide areas of India, particularly in his native United Provinces (now Uttar
            Pradesh state), where his first exposure to the overwhelming poverty and degradation of the peasantry had a
            profound influence on his basic ideas for solving those vital problems. Though vaguely inclined toward
            socialism, Nehru’s radicalism had set in no definite mold. The watershed in his political and economic
            thinking was his tour of Europe and the Soviet Union during 1926–27. Nehru’s real interest in Marxism and
            his socialist pattern of thought stemmed from that tour, even though it did not appreciably increase his
            knowledge of communist theory and practice. His subsequent sojourns in prison enabled him to study Marxism
            in more depth. Interested in its ideas but repelled by some of its methods—such as the regimentation and the
            heresy hunts of the communists—he could never bring himself to accept Karl Marx’s writings as revealed
            scripture. Yet from then on, the yardstick of his economic thinking remained Marxist, adjusted, where
            necessary, to Indian conditions.

            Struggle for Indian independence
            After the Lahore session of 1929, Nehru emerged as the leader of the country’s intellectuals and youth.
            Gandhi had shrewdly elevated him to the presidency of the Congress Party over the heads of some of his
            seniors, hoping that Nehru would draw India’s youth—who at that time were gravitating toward extreme leftist
            causes—into the mainstream of the Congress movement. Gandhi also correctly calculated that, with added
            responsibility, Nehru himself would be inclined to keep to the middle way.

            After his father’s death in 1931, Nehru moved into the inner councils of the Congress Party and became
            closer to Gandhi. Although Gandhi did not officially designate Nehru his political heir until 1942, the
            Indian populace as early as the mid-1930s saw in Nehru the natural successor to Gandhi. The Gandhi-Irwin
            Pact of March 1931, signed between Gandhi and the British viceroy, Lord Irwin (later Lord Halifax),
            signalized a truce between the two principal protagonists in India. It climaxed one of Gandhi’s
            more-effective civil disobedience movements, launched the year before as the Salt March, in the course of
            which Nehru had been arrested.

            Hopes that the Gandhi-Irwin Pact would be the prelude to a more-relaxed period of Indo-British relations
            were not borne out; Lord Willingdon (who replaced Irwin as viceroy in 1931) jailed Gandhi in January 1932,
            shortly after Gandhi’s return from the second Round Table Conference in London. He was charged with
            attempting to mount another civil disobedience movement; Nehru was also arrested and sentenced to two years’
            imprisonment.

            The three Round Table Conferences in London, held to advance India’s progress to self-government, eventually
            resulted in the Government of India Act of 1935, which gave the Indian provinces a system of popular
            autonomous government. Ultimately, it provided for a federal system composed of the autonomous provinces and
            princely states. Although federation never came into being, provincial autonomy was implemented. During the
            mid-1930s Nehru was much concerned with developments in Europe, which seemed to be drifting toward another
            world war. He was in Europe early in 1936, visiting his ailing wife, shortly before she died in a sanitarium
            in Lausanne, Switzerland. Even at that time he emphasized that in the event of war India’s place was
            alongside the democracies, though he insisted that India could fight in support of Great Britain and France
            only as a free country.

            When the elections following the introduction of provincial autonomy brought the Congress Party to power in
            a majority of the provinces, Nehru was faced with a dilemma. The Muslim League under Mohammed Ali Jinnah
            (who was to become the creator of Pakistan) had fared badly at the polls. Congress, therefore, unwisely
            rejected Jinnah’s plea for the formation of coalition Congress–Muslim League governments in some of the
            provinces, a decision that Nehru had supported. The subsequent clash between the Congress and the Muslim
            League hardened into a conflict between Hindus and Muslims that was ultimately to lead to the partition of
            India and the creation of Pakistan.

            Imprisonment during World War II
            At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, had committed India to war
            without consulting the autonomous provincial ministries. The Congress Party’s high command withdrew its
            provincial ministries as a protest, but Congress’s action left the political field virtually open to Jinnah
            and the Muslim League. Nehru’s views on the war differed from those of Gandhi. Initially, Gandhi believed
            that whatever support was given to the British should be given unconditionally and that it should be of a
            nonviolent character. Nehru held that nonviolence had no place in defense against aggression and that India
            should support Great Britain in a war against Nazism but only as a free country. If it could not help, it
            should not hinder.

            In October 1940, Gandhi, abandoning his original stand, decided to launch a limited civil disobedience
            campaign in which leading advocates of Indian independence were selected to participate one by one. Nehru,
